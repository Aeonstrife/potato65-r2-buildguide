### Step 4
Place the plate on the PCB. Make sure that the stabilizers are fitted snugly in the holes on the switch plate. Install switches in the stabilizer locations.
Optional: Install a keycap on each stabilized switch location and make sure they return properly and there is no rattle.

### Step 5
Install switches in all the other switch positions. Install the corner and center switches first for ease of installation. Make sure the switch housing is flush against the plate and that there are no bent pins.
Connect the PCB to a USB cable and make sure that all the switches are working using a key tester.

### Step 6
Gently place the plate and pcb assembly back in the case making sure to slot it USB connector end first. This will prevent the Type C USB connector from getting damaged during installation.

### Step 7
Place the top piece on top of the switch plate so that the screw holes align and flip the whole assembly over and screw in the 8 hex screws using the provided Allen key. You may need to support the top piece to make sure the screws are secure.

:warning: **Do not overtighten the screws. Overtorquing the screws can cause the brass inserts on the top piece to come loose**

### Step 8
